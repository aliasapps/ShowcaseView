ShowcaseView is a simple-use library for Android to display new feature or whatever to the users.

It is very popular issue how to display changes in the applications for owner of the application. Because of this reason, this issue came to necessity to develop how to show changes in the application, and this library is borned and developed.

There are many libraries for showcases, but it is problem to manage history for many of them. For example, your application has BottomNavigationView with three different item. You display new feature on third view with a library. Your flow is: first, application is opened; second, 3rd item is clicked; and then showcase is displayed. After this scenerio, your user can change view via bottom or back button. If the user didn't close showcase before changing the flow, you have to dismiss the showcase before change the UI. If not, the showcase is displayed different and wrong screen.

Because of similar reasons like above, ShowcaseView library is developed. The main advantage of ShowcaseView library is that you don't need to manage or follow view visibility in your codes. Because, when you call the ShowcaseManager to display showcase, ShowcaseManager will start new Activity and in this way, you have not to write extra code to dismiss showcase.

## Gradle

**Step 1.** Add the JitPack repository to your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

**Step 2.** Add the library dependency to your project build.gradle:
```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.erkutaras:ShowcaseView:1.4.0'
}
```


## Usage

Sample code:
```
ShowcaseManager.Builder builder = new ShowcaseManager.Builder();
        builder.context(ShowcaseSampleActivity.this)
                .key("KEY")
                .developerMode(true)
                .view(view)
                .descriptionImageRes(R.mipmap.ic_launcher)
                .descriptionTitle("LOREM IPSUM")
                .descriptionText("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.")
                .buttonText("Done")
                .buttonVisibility(true)
                .cancelButtonVisibility(true)
                .cancelButtonColor(Color.White)
                .add()
                .build()
                .show();

### Listen to Showcase dismisses
If you want to listen showcase dismisses, you can override in your Activity/Fragment like below with `ShowcaseManager.REQUEST_CODE_SHOWCASE`:
```java
    @Override
    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, @Nullable Intent data) {
        if (requestCode == ShowcaseManager.REQUEST_CODE_SHOWCASE && resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {
            // your code
        }
    }
```
